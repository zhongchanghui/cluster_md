PURPOSE of /tests/kernel/storage/mdadm/cluster_md
Description: Test the function for cluster with RAID1.

1.Prepare a machine with a memory greater than or equal to 16G (small memory will cause the virtual machine to run slowly, and data will not be synchronized in time when I/O is executed)

2.Download RHEL OS iso (such as:RHEL-8.1.0-20190806.2-x86_64-dvd1.iso) and store it in the /home/os folder

3.Download (kernel-4.18.0-136.el8.test.x86_64.rpm,kernel-modules-4.18.0-136.el8.test.x86_64.rpm,kernel-core-4.18.0-136.el8.test.x86_64.rpm) which enable cluster function already.then store them to /home/os/kernel136 folder

4.you need Download beaker test repos (Reserver a machine in beaker environment then copies it's /etc/yum.repos.d folder to your local machine)
yum install -y beakerlib-redhat.noarch
yum install -y kernel-kernel-storage-mdadm-include.noarch

4.make run

or you can Execute them one by one:./case.....sh

The order in which the scripts are executed can be seen in runtest.sh
